#  Welcome to the DiceDuel-CPU-opponent Readme file!


This is a game where you can play against the computer to reach a score of 101 or more. You can choose to have a default score of 101 or set your own custom score. The game is built using the Kotlin language and is designed to be run on Android devices with a minimum SDK version of 2021.1.1.

The game involves rolling a set of dice and choosing which ones to keep and which ones to re-roll. You get two chances to re-roll the dice during the game, and once you're satisfied with the result, you can press the score button to add the result to your total score.

There are two game modes available: easy and hard. In the easy mode, the computer uses a random strategy to decide which dice to re-roll. In the hard mode, the computer uses an optimized strategy where all the dice that are less than three are re-rolled.


  To play the game, follow these steps:

    Launch the game on your Android device.
    Choose whether you want to play against the computer or not.
    Choose your game mode (easy or hard).
    Choose the default score of 101 or set your own custom score.
    Start the game by rolling the dice.
    Choose which dice to keep and which to re-roll.
    You have two chances to re-roll the dice.
    Once you're satisfied with the result, press the score button to add the result to your total score.
    The computer will then take its turn and add its score to its total.
    Keep playing until one player reaches the target score or higher.
    The winner will be announced at the end of the game.

That's all you need to know to get started with the Dice Roller Game. Have fun playing!
